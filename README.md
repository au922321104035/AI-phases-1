## Introduction

The Diabetes Prediction system is a Python-based machine learning project that utilizes a pre-trained model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not. This system can be helpful for early diabetes detection and prevention.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost (optional, if used as the machine learning model)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided Jupyter notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost jupyter
```

## Installation

To use the Diabetes Prediction system, follow these steps:
github link:https://github.com/au922321104035/AI-phases-1.git

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/au922321104035/diabetes-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd diabetes-prediction
```

## Usage

### Inference

To make predictions on new data using the pre-trained model, you can use the `predict.py` script:

```bash
python predict.py --input input_data.csv
```

Replace `input_data.csv` with your own data in CSV format, where each row represents a patient with relevant features. The script will output the predictions for each patient.

### Web Application (Optional)

If you have a web application for the Diabetes Prediction system, you can mention its usage here and provide instructions on how to run it.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train the model is stored in the `data` directory. You can find the dataset in the `diabetes_data.csv` file. This dataset contains the necessary features and labels for training the model.

## Model Training

If you wish to retrain the model with different data or algorithms, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. Follow these steps:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the relevant notebook for model training.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and save the model.

## Testing

To run tests on the code, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test.py
```

This will execute the unit tests and ensure that the code functions correctly.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`.
4. Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin feature/new-feature`.
5. Create a pull request on the original repository with a clear description of your changes.

To provide a comprehensive README for a Diabetes Prediction system, including the dataset source and a brief description is essential. Here's an extended version of the README with these additional details:

# Diabetes Prediction System

This is a Python-based Diabetes Prediction system that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database for training and testing the model.

## Dataset Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set
The dataset used in this project, the "Pima Indians Diabetes Database," can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can download the dataset directly from the following URL:

[Diabetes Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes)

Please ensure that you have the dataset file ("diabetes.csv") downloaded and placed in the project directory before running the system.

## Dataset Description

The Pima Indians Diabetes Database contains information about Pima Indian women, a population that has a high incidence of diabetes. The dataset includes various health-related features and a binary target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. Here's a brief description of the dataset's columns:

- *Pregnancies:* Number of times pregnant.
- *Glucose:* Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- *Blood Pressure:* Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- *Skin Thickness:* Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- *Insulin:* 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- *BMI:* Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m)^2).
- *Diabetes Pedigree Function:* A function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- *Age:* Age (years).
- *Outcome:* Target variable, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on these health-related features.
